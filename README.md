# Quest
This is the progress we've made in so far in developing the prototype for our app. In the final product we'll most likely end up using Node.js as this would be accessible on both ios devices and the web.

OUR VISION
We want QUEST to be an app which optimises revision. It caters to students who wish to improve their memorisation skills and decrease the time spent studying and revising. We want to improve on existing algorithms and find the most efficient one, add additional features (such as an Experiment Mode) and have a better, more aesthetically pleasing user interface.
